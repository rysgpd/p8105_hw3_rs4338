## Problem 0:

- Create a public GitHub repo + local R Project: p8105_hw3_rs4338
- Create a single .Rmd file named p8105_hw3_rs4338.Rmd that renders to
  github_document
- Create a subdirectory (data) to store the local data files, and use
  relative paths to access these data files
- Submit a link to your repo via Courseworks:
  <https://github.com/rysgpd/p8105_hw3_rs4338>

``` r
nhanes_demo = read_csv("data/nhanes/nhanes_covar.csv", 
                       skip = 4, 
                       col_types = cols(
                            education = "factor")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na() %>% 
  filter(
    age >= 21
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    sex = ifelse(sex == 1, "Male", "Female")
  )

nhanes_acc_data = read_csv("data/nhanes/nhanes_accel.csv") %>% 
    janitor::clean_names()
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

![](p8105_hw3_rs4338_files/figure-gfm/pressure-1.png)<!-- -->

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to
prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
